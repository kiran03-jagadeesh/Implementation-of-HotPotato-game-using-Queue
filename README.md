### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### AIM: 
To write a python program to simulate the process of passing an item among players and eliminating players based on the given rules until a single winner is determined.
### Algorithm:
1. Initialize the Queue: Create a queue and enqueue all the participants.
2. Pass the Potato: Dequeue the first person in the queue and enqueue them at the end. This simulates passing the potato.
3. Count the Passes: Repeat the passing for a given number of times.
4. Eliminate the Holder: After the set number of passes, remove the person who holds the potato (dequeue the front of the queue).
5. Repeat: Continue the process until only one person remains in the queue.
### Program:











### Output:



### Result:
Thus the simple HotPotato game was implemented using Queue.
